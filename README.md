# Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network
Detect objects in images.
## Getting Started
This project contains one file where you can find the code for model and a dataset that you choose by yourself what king of things you want to predict. Here I've worked on a binary prediction for dogs or cats.

## Prerequisites
* A good GPU for running the model. Incase you're runing it on a CPU, it might be better to make some changes in parameters such as images size and removing convolutional layers and neural network layers.   

## Built With
Python
Anaconda Spyder
Keras
Tensorflow
